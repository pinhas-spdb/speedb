# Speedb
A first-of-its-kind, community-led storage engine designed to support modern data sets. 
It focuses on high performance, optimized for modern storage hardware and scale, on-premise and in the cloud. We strive to simplify the usability of complex data engines as well as stabilize and improve performance.

We are building an open source community where RocksDB and Speedb users and developers can interact, improve, share knowledge, and learn best practices. 
You are welcome to join our community, contribute, and participate in the development of the next generation storage engine.
We welcome any questions or comments you may have. 
Please use issues to submit them, and pull requests to make contributions.

This project is maintained by Speedb and is forked from Rocksdb, developed by Facebook.

**Join us to build the next generation data engine!**

## Benchmarks
Below is a graph comparing Speedb's paired bloom filter with the default bloom filter. 

<img width="769" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-31 at 15 15 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107058910/199016617-4ecbe279-b281-4a8c-b630-87a509bc09da.png">

This test simulates a large number of non-existing keys, with the disk as the bottleneck. The test was running with 1 billion objects, value size of 256 bytes and 4 threads on a system with 8 CPU cores. 

According to the graph, random reads produce significant improvements of up to 140% in this type of workload.


Another test using the same bits per key, memory consumption was reduced by 23%, while performance remained unchanged.
The results are presented in the graph below.
The test was running with 1 billion objects, value size of 256 bytes and 4 threads on a system with 16 CPU cores.

You can read more about our new paired bloom filter algorithm in the [documentation](https://docs.speedb.dev/documentation/speedb-features/paired-bloom-filter).

## Usage
* If speedb is in your default library path:


  In your `CMakeLists.txt` add:
  ```
  target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} speedb)
  ```
  where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of your target application which uses speedb

* Otherwise, you have to include the path to the folder the library is in like so:
	
  ```
  target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} /path/to/speedb/library/folder)
  ```


Usage of the library in your code is the same regardless of whether you statically linked the library or dynamically linked it, and examples can be found under the [examples](examples) directory.
The public interface is in [include](include/rocksdb). Callers should not include or rely on the details of any other header files in this package. Those internal APIs may be changed without warning.


## Build dependencies

Please refer to the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for a list of all the
dependencies and how to install them across different platforms.


## üî® Building Speedb 

Debug:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug [cmake options]
    make speedb

By default the build type is Debug.

Release:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [cmake options]
    make speedb

This will build the static library. If you want to build the dynamic library,
use:

    make speedb-shared

If you want `make` to increase the number of cores used for building, simply use
the `-j` option.

If you want to build a specific target:

    make [target name]

For development and functional testing, go with the debug version which includes
more assertions and debug prints. Otherwise, for production or performance
testing, we recommend building a release version which is more optimized.

## üìà Performance 

We are using DBbench to test performance and progress between the versions. It is available under tools and also in the artifact for direct download.
In there you can also find a readme with the commands we are using to get you started. 





## Documentation
