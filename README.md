# Speedb
Speedb is a library that provides persistent key-value stores. Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays. The keys are ordered within the key value store according to a user-specified comparator function.
It is maintained by Speedb and is forked from Rocksdb, developed by Facebook.

## Usage
* If speedb is in your default library path:


  In your `CMakeLists.txt` add:
  ```
  target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} speedb)
  ```
  where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of your target application which uses speedb

* Otherwise, you have to include the path to the folder the library is in like so:
	
  ```
  target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} /path/to/speedb/library/folder)
  ```


Usage of the library in your code is the same regardless of whether you statically linked the library or dynamically linked it, and examples can be found under the [examples](examples) directory.
The public interface is in [include](include/rocksdb). Callers should not include or rely on the details of any other header files in this package. Those internal APIs may be changed without warning.


## Build dependencies

Please refer to the file [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for a list of all the
dependencies and how to install them across different platforms.

## Building Speedb

Debug:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug [cmake options]
    make rocksdb

By default the build type is Debug.

Release:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release [cmake options]
    make rocksdb

This will build the static library. If you want to build the dynamic library,
use:

    make rocksdb-shared

If you want `make` to increase the number of cores used for building, simply use
the `-j` option.

If you want to build a specific target:

    make [target name]

For development and functional testing, go with the debug version which includes
more assertions and debug prints. Otherwise, for production or performance
testing, we recommend building a release version which is more optimized.
